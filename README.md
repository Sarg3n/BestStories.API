How to run the application
 -> Just download and open. Run it and call the created controller localhost route.

Any assumptions you have made, and any enhancements or changes you would make, given the time.
 -> Took some hours to do it cause i really didn't get why "time" has that format value and how to convert it... 
 -> In a real project of course I would like to use model object classes, however here for a small example I didn't went for that approach. 
 Also thought using linq queries. Maybe put all the uri strings to call in one place all depends of each programmer imagination.
 Also think that using that "for" approach is consuming much time in order to make the necessary changes to the output array, however... it was what I initially did and 
 I got stuck with it till the end.
 
 
With no further issues, with best regards, Nuno.
